Tools to manipulate images.

Using ImageMagick, exiftool, feh, findimagedupes.

Things they can do:
- Find display and remove interactively similar images
- Convert images to black and white
- Rename images and short to subdirs based on exif creation date
- Remove small images based on given resolution
- Shift the exif creation data of images by a given value
- Short images in subfolders bases on brightness/darkness


*Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.*

*I use those regular, but they have their quirks, may broke and maybe superseded by other tools.*
